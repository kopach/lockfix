## ❓ Why? [🔝](#-table-of-contents)

[NPM](https://npmjs.org/) has known issue of constantly changing `integity` property of its lock file. Integrity may change due to plenty of reasons. Some of them are:

- `npm install` done on machine with different OS from one where lock file generated
- some package version updated
- another version of `npm` used

Intention of this tool is to prevent such changes and make `integrity` property secure and reliable.

## ✨ Features [🔝](#-table-of-contents)

- Reverts changes from `sha512` to `sha1`. Keeps untouched changes from `sha1` to `sha512`. `sha512` algorithm is more secure.
- Works well with both `package-lock.json` and `npm-shrinkwrap.json`
- Possibility to revert any changes done by **this tool**
